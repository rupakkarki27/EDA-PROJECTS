# EDA-PROJECTS
In this repo, I'll be adding some EDA projects that I did while on Lockdown due to the Corona Virus.

## I'll also push different file types of the projects.
- If you just want to view them, there are html files
- If you just want the script, .py file (you're welcome)
- And the good old jupyter notebook file.

## Some plots may not render inside GitHub like Plotly plots and some other plots. To see them download the html or ipynb file and run them locally.
